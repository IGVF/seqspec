  "description": "DOGMAseq with digitonin (DIG) is a single-cell multi-omics assay that simultaneously measures protein, RNA, and chromatin accessibility in single cells. The assay is based on the DOGMAseq technology, which uses a DNA-barcoded antibody library to capture proteins of interest, followed by a single-cell RNA-seq protocol and a single-cell ATAC-seq protocol. The DOGMAseq-LLL assay is designed to be compatible with the 10x Genomics Chromium platform.",
