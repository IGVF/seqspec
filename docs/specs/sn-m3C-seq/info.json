  "description": "Single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (sn-m3C-seq). Specification assumes 2x151bp paired-end reads with 10bp dual indices based on snmC-seq3 and chromatin confirmation capture. Note that all reads are simultaneously bisulfite-converted gDNA containing potential 3C ligation junctions.",
